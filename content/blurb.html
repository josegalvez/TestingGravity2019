Testing Gravity 2019 is the 3rd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the <a href="../TestingGravity2015/">2015</a> and the <a href="../TestingGravity2017/">2017</a> meetings, Testing Gravity 2019 will feature the latest updates from the gravitational wave detectors, cosmological surveys and other experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test.

Wednesday, January 23rd, will feature a "school" with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, January 24-26, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.
