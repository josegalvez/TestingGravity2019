Testing Gravity 2019 will be the 3rd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU. Like the <a href="../TestingGravity2015/">2015</a> and the <a href="../TestingGravity2017/">2017</a> meetings, Testing Gravity 2019 will provide an opportunity for experts on different ways of testing Gravity to meet and exchange their ideas. There will be a one-day school on Wednesday, January 23rd, featuring five review lectures by some of the invited speakers covering the key topics of the conference. The main conference, January 24-26, will feature invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.

Testing Gravity remains a topical theme, with the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy remaining unexplained, and with the continued search for a quantum theory of gravity. The TG conference series brings together the world's top experts - theorists, experimentalist and observers, to discuss new ways of testing General Relativity and its alternatives. It provides theorists working on alternative theories with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers welcome the chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test. Topics include gravitational waves, table-top experiments, solar system tests, particle astrophysics and cosmology.
