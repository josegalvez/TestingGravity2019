		<div>Testing Gravity 2019 is the 3rd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of Gravity. The conference will provide an opportunity for experts on different ways of testing Gravity to meet and exchange their ideas. There will be a one-day school on Wednesday, January 23rd, featuring five review lectures covering the key topics of the conference. The main conference, January 24-26, will feature invited and contributed talks, and a poster session. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme, as there remain significant gaps in our understanding of gravity, such as reconciling gravity with quantum theory and the unexplained nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy. The Testing Gravity conference series brings together the world's top experts - theorists, experimentalist and observers, to discuss new ways of testing General Relativity and some of the alternative gravity theories. It provides theorists working on alternative gravity theories with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers welcome the chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test. Topics include gravitational waves, table-top experiments, solar system tests, particle astrophysics and cosmology.</div>
